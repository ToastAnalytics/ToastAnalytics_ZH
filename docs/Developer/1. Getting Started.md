# Overview

Analytics not only provide the analysis on the use pattern of the users running the game app along with data on various indices but also an ‘one-stop’ in-app campaign management service with which you can handle everything from A to Z, from selecting the target appropriated for your purpose.<br />

To use the analysis data and campaign management service that Analytics offer, you need to, first, register your company and app, followed by applying the SDK provided by Analytics.(SDK supports iOS, Android and Unity).
