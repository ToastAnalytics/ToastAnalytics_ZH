# Required Sync 
The following APIs need to be synced to collect basic statistics data. You can view most of the data only by implementing the following items. 

The following APIs need to be synced. 
* Initialize: initializeSDK
* Session tracking: traceActivation, traceDeactivation
* Purchase (In App Purchase): tracePurchase
* Acquire/use goods: traceMoneyAcquisition, traceMoneyConsumption
* Level up: traceLevelUp
* Number of friends: traceFriendCount

## Initialize

You need “App Authentication Key” and “Company ID” issued after registering app in order to use the SDK. Please refer to this link (<http://cloud.toast.com/documents/2/>) for more information on how to register your app.
![AppKey](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ToastAnalytics/ToastAnalytics_EN/master/docs/Developer/images/pg_ios_002.png)

In order to use GameAnalytics SDK, you need to perform SDK initialization first.<br>
initializeSDK function in GameAnalytics class is for initializing SDK. This function is for checking data (device and app setting info) required internally and configuring for log sending. 
```objective-c
- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions
{
  ……
  [TAGAnalytics initializeSdk:@"AppKey"
			        companyId:@"CompanyID"
			       appVersion:@"AppVersion"
		     useLoggingUserId:NO];
  ……
}
```

### Setting User Categorizing Standard 
**We recommend you to refrain from changing the standard once the game is released since changing the standard for user categorizing while operating the game will make the connection of data before and after such change disappear.**   
Analytics use Advertise ID or User ID as the standard for user categorization. Both cannot be used at once, but you must select one of these two options based on your game policy.   
In most of the cases, Advertise ID is used. However, if there is a certain requirement in game, you may also opt for User ID.   
For instance, if you use Advertise ID as the user categorization even if a user withdraws and re-registers using an identical device, he/she will be recorded as an identical user. However, when User ID is in use, upon re-sign up, the user will be considered as a new user.   
Taking a case when a single user uses 2 devices as an example, with Advertise ID those two devices will be considered to have come from two different users; whereas with User ID, it will only be considered as one person.   
Thus, you need to take such difference in account when deciding the standard.   
You will use the last parameter (use logging userid flag) of the initialization function (initializeSDK) for setting such identifier: when the Flag is ‘true’, the user identifier will be User ID, when false it will be Advertise ID.   
Below example is when User ID is used as the user differentiator.   
```objective-c
- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions
{
  ……
  int result = [TAGAnalytics initializeSdk:@"AppKey"
		            			 companyId:@"CompanyID"
					            appVersion:@"AppVersion"
				          useLoggingUserId:YES];
  if (result != 0) {
	 // Initialize Fail
  }

  // Complete login process in game 
  ……
  // Function for registering User ID, when User ID is used as user identifier.
  [TAGAnalytics setLoggingUserId:@"user id"];
……
}
```

When the last parameter (user logging userid flag) of the initialization function is set as ‘true,’ you need to call setLoggingUserID to register User ID. If you forget to call setLoggingUserId after setting the flag as ‘true,’ all the APIs that you call afterwards will return ‘failure (E_LOGGING_USER_ID_EMPTY).’.<br>
"useCampaignOrPromotion" in setUserId will be ‘true’ when you use promotion or campaign activity. If not, it will be ‘false.’<br>
setUserId function should be called right after acquiring userID used in game after calling initializeSDK and succeed in logging into the game. Please enter a value for identifying the user for ‘userID.’ <br> 
Please refer to below link for more information on Advertise ID.<br>
<https://developer.apple.com/LIBRARY/ios/documentation/AdSupport/Reference/ASIdentifierManager_Ref/index.html>

## Session Tracking

This synchronization is for tracking the DAU (Daily Active User) and game retention time.<br> 
This can be measured by calling the API appropriate for desired action when starting/terminating app or moving to background/foreground mode.<br>
When the app is implemented for the first time (after initializeSDK) or when transferring from background to foreground, it starts session tracking by calling traceActivation. The session tracking will be suspended by calling traceDeactivation when the app returns to the background mode.<br>
If traceDeactivation is called, it automatically calculates the lapse time between traceActivation and traceDeactivation to infer the ‘game play time.’ The work executed by SDK will also be suspended by traceDeactivation.<br>
You MUST call this API since if you fail to do so when moving to background/foreground mode, you will not be able to measure the exact game play time. <br>
DAU will be calcualted by subtracting the duplicated users from users (based on Advertise ID or User ID) who had called traceActivation in the day.
```objective-c
- (void)applicationWillResignActive:(UIApplication *)application
{
	[TAGAnalytics traceDeactivation];
}

- (void)applicationDidBecomeActive:(UIApplication *)application
{
	[TAGAnalytics traceActivation];
}
```
## Action Tracking

You can track users’ action including in-app purchase, money acquisition/use, level-up, changes in number of friends and so on. 

### 1. In-App Purchase
Once a user makes an in-app purchase, tracePurchase shall be called to send sales related information.<br>
For currency, code defined in ISO-4217(<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217>) will be used.<br>
Below example shows the case of purchasing a gem of $0.99.<br>
("GEM_10" as written below is the item code which had been defined in game. Unit Cost is the unit price of the item and payment is the actual payment that the user had made. For ‘level,’ enter the level of the purchasing user.)
```objective-c
[TAGAnalytics tracePurchase:@"GEM_10"
                    payment:0.99
                   unitCost:0.99
                   currency:@"USD"
                      level:10];
```
### 2. Acquiring/Using Goods 
This function is called when acquiring/using goods in game and also when tracking the changes in the initial and secondary goods. The initial goods mean those purchased through in-app purchase (ex. Gems & rubies), whereas secondary goods (ex. Cherry, heart and so on) refer to those purchased using the first goods. <br>
Below example shows the case when 10 gems had been purchased using in-app purchase.<br>
("CODE_IAP" is the code defined in game. For ‘type’ use 0 in the case of initial goods and ‘1,’ for the secondary goods.)
```objective-c
[TAGAnalytics traceMoneyConsumption:@"CODE_IAP"
	                           type:@"0"
                  consumptionAmount:10
	                          level:10];
```

Below example shows the case when 100 cherries had been bought using 10 gems.
```objective-c
// Use initial goods
[TAGAnalytics traceMoneyConsumption:@"CODE_USE_GEM"
				               type:@"0"
		          consumptionAmount:10
				              level:10];

// Use secondary goods
[TAGAnalytics traceMoneyAcquisition:@"CODE_BUY_CHERRY"
				               type:@"0"
		          consumptionAmount:10
				              level:10];
```

In case a user had bought secondary goods using the initial goods, the initial goods will decrease whereas the number of secondary goods will increase. However, if you don’t want to consider a case where the initial goods had been used to buy the secondary ones as ‘the consumption of goods,’ all you need to do is to send the log only for the ‘acquisition of secondary goods.’

### 3. Level-Up
traceLevelUp is called if there is a change in a user level. For your reference, action tracking API receives the user level as below in order to track the action for each level. <br>
If the user level changes to level 10, below function is called. However, in this case the level of one user must go up. An accurate data cannot be measured in case where the level drops.<br>
For instance, in a stage game like "Candy Crush Sage,” where each stage is used identically as the level, you need to leave the level-up log when proceeding to the next stage for the first time. Level-up log shall not be left when going back to the previous stage again to play.<br>
Please note that you need to use the user’s highest stage as the level value, not the currently playing stage, for the level value delivered to another API.
```
[TAGAnalytics traceLevelUp:10];
```

### 4. Friend
It is for registering the number of friends of the user. Generally speaking, you need to call this function once the friend information is successfully loaded after running the app.
```objective-c
[TAGAnalytics traceFriendCount:100]; 
```

# Selective Synchronization

We will explains how to create an index that you want to measure additionally apart from the default indices offered through basic synchronization as well as how to use the campaign feature provided by Analytics.

Below items can be synced additionally:
* Sync Campaign : setCampaignListener, (show/hide)Campaign
* Collect Custom Event : traceEvent
* Measure time take : traceStartSpeed, traceEndSpeed

## Sync Campaign

### 1. Preparations for Campaign Sync
We offer a separate guide on how to sync and implement campaign. <br>
Please go to Toast Analytics > "Run Campaign" menu and refer to the “Page Guide.” 

### 2. Sync Push
APNS is used for campaign in Analytics SDK. In order to use APNS, you need to register the authentication certificate to the Analytics admin page.<br>
Please refer to “Getting Started” documentation, especially the “Set Push” part on how to register information to the Analytics admin page.
```objective-c
- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions
{
  ……
  // SDK initialization
  [TAGAnalytics initializeSdk:@"AppKey"
      	            companyId:@"CompanyID"
			       appVersion:@"AppVer"
		     useLoggingUserId:NO];
  ……

  // Deliver the push data to SDK, if push had been received.
  if (launchOptions != nil)
  {
	NSDictionary* dictionary = [launchOptions objectForKey:UIApplicationLaunchOptionsRemoteNotificationKey];
	if (dictionary != nil)
	  [TAGAnalytics setPushData:dictionary];
  }

  // Request for push token upon APNS.
  if ([[[UIDevice currentDevice] systemVersion] floatValue] >= 8.0)
	{
	[[UIApplication sharedApplication] registerUserNotificationSettings:[UIUserNotificationSettings 
	  settingsForTypes:(UIUserNotificationTypeSound | UIUserNotificationTypeAlert |
	UIUserNotificationTypeBadge) 
	categories:nil]];
	[[UIApplication sharedApplication] registerForRemoteNotifications];
  }
  else
  {
	[[UIApplication sharedApplication] registerForRemoteNotificationTypes:
	(UIUserNotificationTypeBadge | UIUserNotificationTypeSound | 
	UIUserNotificationTypeAlert)];
  }
  ……
}

- (void)application:(UIApplication *)application didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken:(NSData *) deviceToken
{
  // If push token is normally registered, deliver the token to SDK.
  [TAGAnalytics tracePushToken:deviceToken];
}

- (void)application:(UIApplication *)application didReceiveRemoteNotification:(NSDictionary *)userInfo
{
// Deliver push data to SDK, when received push. 
[TAGAnalytics setPushData:userInfo];
}

```

### 3. Implementing and Registering Campaign Listener 
SDK communicates with campaign server on a regular basis and retrieves campaign/reward related information. If there is a campaign to be executed to the users or reward that the user needs to receive, it notifies through TAGCampaignDelegate.<br>
Thus, to receive campaign information, you need to implement TAGCampaignDelegate first.
```
@protocol TAGCampaignDelegate <NSObject>
-(void)analyticsDidMissionComplete:(NSArray*)missionList;
-(void)analyticsDidCampaignVisibilityChange:(NSString*)adspaceName show:(BOOL)show;
-(void)analyticsDidCampaignLoadSuccess:(NSString*)adspaceName;
-(void)analyticsDidCampaignLoadFail:(NSString*)adspaceName errorCode:(int)errorCode 
  errorMessage:(NSString*)errorMessage;
-(void)analyticsDidPromotionVisibilityChanged:(BOOL)show;
@end
```

Each Callback will be called in below cases.  
* analyticsDidCampaignVisibilityChange: showCampaign or hideCampaign will be called when campaign related pop-up/banners appear or disappear.

* analyticsDidMissionComplete: It is called when the user had executed campaign/promotion and if the user needs to receive a reward upon achieving a certain mission. You need to grant the reward through game server by using the received information here. Please refer to the “Campaign Application Guide” for more information on how to provide campaign rewards. 

* analyticsDidCampaignLoadSuccess, analyticsDidCampaignLoadFail: It notifies the campaign information parsing result retrieved from the server. This Callback doesn’t need to process a special process in game. It is only provided for checking logs. 
Use setCampaignDelegate during registration for the implemented TAGCampaignDelegate.

* analyticsDidPromotionVisibilityChange: It is not currently used in iOS.

```objective-c
- (void)viewDidLoad {
  ……
  [TAGAnalytics setCampaignDelegate:self];
  ……
}

……

-(void)analyticsDidMissionComplete:(NSArray *)missionList
{
  // missionList Array, as NSString, is a mission string.
  // The key/value information in mission string is provided with identifier ‘|’.
  // Verify this value in promotion server through the game server and 
  // grant reward to user. 
}

- (void)analyticsDidCampaignVisibilityChange:(NSString *)adspaceName show:(BOOL)show
{
  // Banner/pop-up visibility change
}

- (void)analyticsDidCampaignLoadSuccess:(NSString *)adspaceName
{
  // for Debugging
}

- (void)analyticsDidCampaignLoadFail:(NSString *)adspaceName errorCode:(int)errorCode errorMessage:(NSString *)errorMessage
{
  // for Debugging
}
```

### 4. Show/Hide Campaign
This method is for showing the campaign pop-up/banner registered in Analytics website, while hiding the exposed pop-up/banner if there is an ongoing campaign for the current users. Please use adspace name that you had defined in Analytics website when registering the campaign for the adspaceName parameter. Adspace refers to a specific location in game where the pop-up/banner appears.<br>

Since showCampaign() method will not invoke any action if there is no campaign using the adspace, we advise you to call different adspaceName functions in various locations of game, respectively, where campaign pop-up/banner is expected to appear. Then, the game admin will be able to easily expose pop-up/banner only by registering the campaign to the Analytics website without additionally modifying the game client. 

For more information on how to register Adspace, please refer to the “Campaign Test Guide.”
```objective-c
+(int)showCampaign:(NSString*)adspaceName parent:(UIView*)parent;
+(int)showCampaign:(NSString*)adspaceName parent:(UIView*)parent animation:(int)animation 
  lifeTime:(int)lifeTime;
+(int)hideCampaign:(NSString*)adspaceName;
+(int)hideCampaign:(NSString*)adspaceName animation:(int)animation;
```
## Use Custom Event

This function is used when you wish to define and analyze a specific event per game.<br>
When using ‘Fever Time Item,’ for instance, below function will be used. All the coding used shall be defined in game. Below example is the code defined for tracking the item change in a certain stage. 
```objective-c
[TAGAnalytics traceEvent:@"ITEM"
               eventCode:@"ITEM_USE"
                  param1:@"FEVER"
                  param2:@"STAGE_10"
                   value:1
                   level:10];
```

It can be used when tracking the result of boss battle in a specific level. 
```objective-c
[TAGAnalytics traceEvent:@"STAGE"
               eventCode:@"STAGE_BOSS_VICTORY"
                  param1:@"DRAGON_VALLEY"
                  param2:@"BOSS_MOB"
                   value:1
                   level:10];
```

Other than these, you may use this function for various purposes including tracking an event specialized for game.<br>

String Type parameter (event type, event code, param1, param2) used in traceEvent is usable up to 50byte for each case. You may also use up to 300 items for param1 and up to 200 items for param2 which may occur under the event.<br>
 
Please refer to the guidelines offered in TOAST Analytics website for more information. (You may download the guide by clicking the “Page Guide” located on right top of the custom event page) 

## Measure the Time Taken

You may also calculate the time taken in a certain section. For instance, you can use this feature on whichever section you require when you wish to calculate the time that the user had spent on ‘Tutorial,’ or time required for scene transition.<br>

If you wish to calculate the loading time in ‘Intro Scene,’ below is the function you require. "INTRO_LOADING" is the value defined in game for a specific section.
```objective-c
- (void) onStart() 
{
  [TAGAnalytics traceStartSpeed:@"INTRO_LOADING"];
}

- (void) onLoadCompleted() {
  [TAGAnalytics traceEndSpeed:@"INTRO_LOADING"];
}
```

## Set SDK

### 1. Activate Debugging Mode
You may set whether to print out log or not to check SDK during development.<br>
This function can be called both bore and after calling initializeSDK. The default value is setDebugMode(false). 
Log tags starts with "Analytics:". You can directly check the logs occurring in SDK if you set log cat filter as “Analytics” in Eclipse.
```objective-c
- (void) Start ()
{
  ……
 [TAGAnalytics setDebugEnabled:YES];
  ……
}
```

You may check details on sent log if debugging mode is activated. You can check if the log is successfully delivered or not by checking the response log after sending a log. If the log string as shown below is present, it means the collected data has normally been delivered to the server. (‘***’ refers to the value which may differ according to circumstances.)
```
iOS : RequestWorkerThread::didReceiveResponse - <NSHTTPURLResponse: ***> { URL: *** } { status code: 200,
```

### 2. Check Device Information
You can check the device information collected by SDK as well.<br>
What you can check currently are Device ID, Push Token and Campaign User ID. Aforementioned values are required when testing campaign sync. Please refer to “Campaign Sync Guide” for more information.
```objective-c
void printDeviceInfo() 
{
  NSString *deviceID = [TAGAnalytics deviceInfoWithKey:DEVICE_INFO_DEVICEID];
  NSString *pushToken = [TAGAnalytics deviceInfoWithKey:DEVICE_INFO_TOKEN;
  NSString *cUserID = [TAGAnalytics deviceInfoWithKey:DEVICE_INFO_CAMPAIGN_USERID];
  ……
}
```

### 3. Check SDK Version
You can check the SDK version with "getVersion()" function.
```objective-c
[TAGAnalytics version];
```
