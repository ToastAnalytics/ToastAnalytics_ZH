# Overview

Promotion in Analytics is a function that can advance promotion by mutually sharing user traffic among games that utilize Analytics and exposing advertisements. Promotion can be regarded as the native advertisement platform in the web view format to which sophisticated targeting technics are applied. Games applied with promotion of Analytics send user traffic through promotion board by engaging as inventory game and expose their own game advertisements in other games' promotion board at the same time.
In addition, a variety of contents that can draw inflow users' attention as well as game advertisements are provided in the promotion board. At this point, relevant games can be indirectly advertised once again through some characters or game screenshots of games of member companies that participate in the promotion, and contents that can vitalize promotion can be produced. 

## Inventory App Setting

Expose advertisements and contents within promotion board to users by displaying the promotion icon at all times and showing the promotion board as web view in case of touching the icon. At this time, provide goods within the game to icon-clicking users as reward for clicking once a day 


## Target App (object game) Promotion Setting

Games that in-pour users to the promotion board by setting as inventory app can expose their own games to the promotion board. Promotion can be created that register advertisement materials and words and provide not only missions to the target users who are in-poured to the game by clicking related advertisements but also reward if they accomplish the missions

## Promotion Board

Promotion board is provided to horizontal/vertical type games as web view, and a total of 8 feed are exposed. Out of these, the first and third domains’ feed are promotion advertisements of corresponding games, and the rest 6 feed are contents. Clicking advertisements exposed in the promotion board either leads a move to Google Play Store or triggers game execution in case of previously installed games.

Promotion is expected to induce returning effects of dormant users as well as new users’ in-pour by carrying out promotions to genuine gamers as a target at all times and conducting monitoring.

If you complete the inventory setting for promotion in the ‘App setting > Promotion’ page, the icon that you have registered will be regularly exposed in game and the defined reward will be given once to the user if he/she clicks the icon for the first time in the day. 

![App Setting > Set Promotion Inventory](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ToastAnalytics/ToastAnalytics_EN/master/docs/Developer/images/appSetting_inventorySetting.png)   
[App Setting > Set Promotion Inventory]

* Location for exposing the icon in game: You can set the location freely in game and this will automatically be applied to SDK.

Ex.) Phrase for notice on the reward provision for clicking the ‘On’ icon – Thank you for your participation to the promotion. You have received a reward for clicking the ‘On’ icon to your gift box.

* Icon exposure status: The status column is a place for displaying the exposure process of the inventory icon and the status will be changed from Registration Complete [Test], Test Complete [Implement] to In Implementation [Suspend]. 
 * Registration Complete & [Test] button: This stage is shown when the inventory information has been registered and the test has yet to be completed. If you tap [Test] button, you will be able to run test regarding the icon exposure and reward provision. Cf.) Please refer to ‘2.Registering Testing Device and 3. Test for more information. 
 * Test Complete & [Implement] button: This phase refers to a situation where the test has been completed and you can start exposing the promotion icon in game by tapping [Implement] button. 
 * In Implementation & [Suspend] button: This phase is when the icon is exposed in game and upon tapping [Suspend] button, icon will become invisible instantly and exposure suspension request mail will also be sent to the admin in charge of the promotion operation.

Please note that once you edit inventory’s basic information, all tests that had been conducted will be initialized, thus you might have to run the tests from the beginning. Should you wish to re-run the test even though the test had been completed, you can initialize the testing stage by clicking [Edit] button. 
 

#### 2.Registering Testing Device
