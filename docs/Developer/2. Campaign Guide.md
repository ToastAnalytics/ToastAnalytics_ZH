# Overview

‘Campaign’ in Analytics refers to the in-house campaign. This feature exposes event (mission) to the users through pop-up or banner in the app and provides rewards when the user has joined events.

In-house campaign by the Toast Analytics automatically provides the indices including the surge of user volume due to the campaign as well as the performance analysis from the sales increase. You can also easily target the object meeting the purpose of desired campaign in order to maximize the campaign effect.

You need to go through below processes additionally in order to use the campaign feature. This document includes detailed explanation on how to perform each of the processes.

1. You need to apply Toast Analytics SDK to the app client in order to expose campaign and handle rewards. 
2. You also need a communication between game server (or application server) and campaign server in order to notify the user in case the user had accomplished mission or for checking the rewards.

[Image 1 Service Motion Flow]

Below is the short description on key elements required during synchronization and more detailed description will be offered in the latter part of this document.

###1. Applying TOAST Analytics SDK 
In order to use Analytics Campaign feature, you first need to apply Toast Analytics SDK to your application. 
Please refer to the end part of this document for more information on application and you can also refer to the “Toast Analytics API Reference” provided additionally. 

###2. Setting a Campaign
Although you can directly create a new campaign, using the template, you can create your desired campaign in an easier and quicker manner. 
You can register a new campaign through the [Run Campaign] in Toast Analytics website. Please refer to the [Page Guide] located on right top of the relevant page for more information.

###3. Registering Test Device 
Before exposing the campaign to the general users, you need to test first to check whether the campaign is normally shown or operating. Before registering the testing device, acquire the Device ID and Device Token first through Toast Analytics SDK.
You may register the testing device by going to Analytics website and clicking [App Setting Button] > [Set Campaign] > [Set Testing Device].

###4. Proceed with the Campaign Test 
Once the testing device is successfully registered, go to [Campaign Operation Menu] > [Campaign List] > [Test Button]in the Toast Analytics website and start testing.

###5. Check Campaign Operation 
And then, you will need to check whether the campaign is operating normally using the testing device. Please check the operation in below 4 stages. Go to the [Page Guide] in the right top of the Toast Analytics website for more information on each stage. 

However, checking mission accomplishment & reward status is available only within the campaigns set with the mission and reward feature.
- Expose: This stage refers to a status when the campaign information has normally been delivered to the testing device, thus being ready to be exposed.
- Implement: It refers to a stage where you had successfully joined the campaign through banner or pop-up exposed in testing device.
- Mission: It refers to a stage where the mission data has been normally delivered from the game server to the campaign server.
- Reward: It refers to a case when the information had been successfully delivered from campaign server to the game server. 

###6. Expose Campaign
Once you had completed the test for campaign, you may open the campaign for external users to access. If the app has reached the campaign exposure location (Refer to ‘Set Campaign > Set Exposure Location’ section) upon campaign launch, the campaign will be revealed to the general users. 

###7. Mission Completion and Rewards 
If a user had conducted a certain action (for instance, a change in level or ranking) to achieve the campaign’s mission, the game server will call campaign server API (check mission) to verify whether the mission had been accomplished or not. 
If the mission is successfully accomplished, the reward information will be sent from the campaign server to the game server and the game server has to send the reward to client based on such information.

#Campaign Configuration

##Configuration: Set before executing campaign 

You need to enter required information in “App Setting > Set Campaign” as well as “Set Push” in order to implement campaign. 
“Set Exposure Location,” as a required field, is a menu for registering the location where the campaign image will be exposed in game and “Set mission and Reward Item” shall be registered only when there is existing reward. 
You should set “Set Rendering” only when you wish to use user-defined ‘Close’ button. This field is unnecessary when you opt for using the image provided by the system. 
You must register at least one testing device to “Set Testing Device” field to test the campaign. 
When executing a campaign using ‘push’ feature, you must fill in required information for “Set Push” field.

[Image 4 Location of Campaign Setting Menu]

###1.Set Campaign > Set Exposure Location and Test 
It is for setting the key which is a unique identifier for a location where the campaign pop-up or banner will be exposed in app. You must run test for each of the OS respectively in order to check whether the images are normally displayed after registering the pop-up and banner.

![Project Sett](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ToastAnalytics/ToastAnalytics_EN/master/docs/Developer/images/image007.jpg)
[Image 5 Set Location to Expose Campaign]

“Exposure Location” shall not be overlapping and only one campaign is available to one location at a time. 
Identical key is used for both Android and iOS. In order to expose the campaign pop-up/banner to a specific location, you need to import the KEY parameter of SDK’s campaign exposure API.
The status of the exposure location is categorized into 3 parts - [Test], [Check Result], [Complete Sync] - and you will NOT be able to edit or delete the KEY value in [Check Result] and [Complete Sync] Stage.

![Project Sett](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ToastAnalytics/ToastAnalytics_EN/master/docs/Developer/images/image008.jpg)   
[Image 6 Pop-up for Editing the Campaign Exposure Location]

“Test Exposure Location” is a feature for checking whether the exposing location is normally inserted to the source.

Each status value is as follows:
- [Test] 
You may start testing in this phase.
- [Check Result] 
In [Check Result] stage, the test promotion is underway in the relevant exposure location. You can check whether the desired promotion is normally displayed in the exposure location through the app inserted with the actual source. You must re-run the app in order to test newly registered promotion. If you have confirmed a normal display of the promotion, the status will be changed to [Complete Sync] stop upon clicking this button. If not, it will be initialized to the [Test] stage.
- [Complete Sync]
This stage refers to a situation where the exposure location has been confirmed to has been successfully inserted to the source. 

###2. Set Campaign > Set Mission and Reward Item 
If the box for ‘mission and reward’ is checked (as being used) in “Run Campaign > Create Campaign > Default Setting,” relevant value must be entered as a requirement. Identical mission and reward items are used across OS.

![Project Sett](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ToastAnalytics/ToastAnalytics_EN/master/docs/Developer/images/image009.jpg)
[Image 7 Pop-up for Editing Campaign Exposure Location]

We advise you to discreetly enter the campaign since it cannot be edited or deleted once you run the campaign test.

###5. Set Push
To use push sending feature, you need to be issued with APNS certificate (iOS) or GCM API Key (Android) and register such information to the ‘Set Push’ page. Please refer to below items on how to check and register certificate and API Key for each platform. 

######Set iOS Push

APNS(Apple Push Notification Service) is used for iOS Push notification. Thus, your app must be registered to the Apple Developer Center and your push feature must also be activated for you to use the push sending feature.
If your app is registered and push is activated, you will be able to view below information upon selecting the app.   

![Project Sett](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ToastAnalytics/ToastAnalytics_EN/master/docs/Developer/images/image015.png)   
[Image 13 Register App and Activate Push in APNS (iOS)]

Once the app is registered and push is activated for use, you then need to register the Push certificate to the Analytics. The iOS Push certificate that Analytics use is .p12 certificate and you must go through below process for the issuance. 

####Step 1. Select [Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles] menu in Apple Developer Center and check registered app in [Certificates] menu.
Given that your app is normally registered, you will be able to find your app name along with APNS Development iOS, APNs Production iOS certificate. If you select the APNs Production iOS certificate, it will be downloadable. Please note that in order to use Push feature in Analytics Service, you would need the Production Certificate, not the Development one.

#Creating a Campaign

When it comes to creating a campaign, you could either use the template or manually enter all required information. If you use template for regularly operated campaigns, you can create campaigns much easily and quickly.

##Creating a Campaign Template

Campaign template is offered for frequently implemented campaigns or those with a specific purpose. There are 5 templates provided: template for ‘preventing initial churn,’ ‘preventing churn,’ ‘encouraging return,’ ‘encouraging initial purchase’ and ‘encouraging re-purchase.’ 
You are unable to delete these default templates provided by the system.

![Project Sett](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ToastAnalytics/ToastAnalytics_EN/master/docs/Developer/images/image23.JPG)   
[Image 23 Template List]

If you wish to save already implemented campaign as a template, you may do so in the ‘Detailed Setting’ page of ‘Create Campaign.’ Created template will be listed in “Create Campaign with Template” page and it can also be deleted by yourself.

![Project Sett](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ToastAnalytics/ToastAnalytics_EN/master/docs/Developer/images/image33.png)   
[Image 33 Push Setting among Campaign’s Detailed Setting]


As for the sending time, you can choose either ‘one-off’ for sending only once when running the campaign or ‘repeated’ for sending the Push on a daily/weekly basis at a designated time. (As for one-off sending, up to one hour could be taken until you successfully send the Push.) 

#Campaign Test

You can run a test before the actual campaign to check whether the setting is properly displayed. You can distribute the campaign to your users after completing the test.

##Campaign Status

Campaign created with template or through user’s manual input, will be exposed in “Campaign List.”

![Project Sett](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ToastAnalytics/ToastAnalytics_EN/master/docs/Developer/images/image34.png)   
[Image 34 Newly Created Campaign Exposed in Campaign List]

The “Status” column will be changed into one of the following 6 items; 1) Save Temporarily, 2) Complete Registration [Test], 3) Complete Test [Run], 4) Pending Implementation [Suspend], 5) In Implementation [Suspend]and 6) Terminate.
1) Save Temporarily: If you click [Save Temporarily] button after entering only some of the required information, your information will be saved in ‘Save Temporarily’ mode. In this stage, you can either edit the campaign setting or delete the whole campaign.   
2) Complete Registration [Test]: After filling in all required information for the campaign followed by tapping [Create] button, your campaign will be in ‘Saved’ stage pending for testing. You can run a test for created campaign with [Test] button. Please refer to ‘2. Run Test’ section for more information on testing.   
3) Complete Test [Run]: This stage is exposed once the campaign test is completed.   
4) Pending Implementation [Suspend]: If you click [Run] button before the campaign launch date, it will still be in standby mode, only to be changed to In Implementation [Suspend] on the campaign launch date automatically. If you tap [Suspend] button in ‘Pending Implementation’ mode you will return to ‘Complete Test [Run].’   
5) In Implementation [Suspend]: Tapping [Run] button after the campaign launch date will implement the campaign and the campaign will be exposed to the users. If you select [Suspend] button in this stage, it will terminate the campaign even if the termination date designated when you first created the campaign has yet to come.

##Run Test

Click ‘Test’ button by going to “Run Campaign > Campaign List > Status > Complete Registration [Test]” to see if the registered campaign is normally operating.   
* The test is categorized into “Campaign Pre-running Test” where you can see if the campaign is implemented with clicking the pop-up/banner and “Push Sending Test” to check if you can receive the push on your device.   

####1) Running Campaign Test When There is No Push 
Upon clicking the ‘Test’ button when there is no push, a pop-up as shown below will be exposed. 
Clicking “Test” in pop-up will invoke the testing.

![Project Sett](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ToastAnalytics/ToastAnalytics_EN/master/docs/Developer/images/image35.png)   
[Image 35 Campaign Test Pop-up (when there is no push)]

Check if the campaign is normally exposed by running the application installed in device registered through “Setting > Set Campaign > Set Testing Device” or running the app by tapping the push message. 

######When Campaign is Not Displayed
- Check if the device information is normally entered in “Set Testing Device”.
- Check if the “Exposure Location” is accurately entered to the application. 

######If Campaign is Normally Terminated 
If you click ‘View Result’ after completing the pop-up /banner test, the status of exposure and implementation will be changed to ‘Complete.’ If the test is run for ‘push,’ the implementation status will also be changed to ‘Complete.’
For campaigns with missions and rewards, you must achieve the registered mission first before checking the reward. Once successfully fulfilling the test, you will be able to find out the status of mission and reward being changed to ‘Complete’ as well. 

######If Mission is Exposed as ‘Failure’ 
- Check if the user’s mission achievement status and relating information had normally called campaign REST API. 
- Check if there was any issue in server communication when calling campaign REST API. 

######If Reward is Exposed as ‘Failure’
- Check if the app normally received the reward information once the mission is complete. 
- This process could take up to 5 minutes once the mission is over and you can directly check the result when logging in again after exiting the application.
- Check if the reward provision information has successfully called the campaign REST API once the reward has been received. 
- You must check the validity through campaign REST API before sending out the reward. 


####2) Testing Campaign if there is a Push 

![Project Sett](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ToastAnalytics/ToastAnalytics_EN/master/docs/Developer/images/image36.png)   
[Image 36 Campaign Test Pop-up (when there is a push)]

For "Push Sending Test,” the push will be sent to a device registered in “Setting > Set Campaign > Set Testing Device” regardless whether push had been successfully sent or not.

######If the Testing Device Failed to Receive Push 
- Check if the certificate info is correct in “Setting > Set Push.”
- Check if the device token info is correct in “Setting > Set Campaign > Set Testing Device.” 
- If sending the push is still unavailable even after checking above steps, leave your inquiries via “Inquire” button.
