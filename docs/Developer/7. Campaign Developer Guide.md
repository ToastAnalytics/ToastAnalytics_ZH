# Overview

‘Campaign’ in Analytics refers to the in-house campaign. This feature exposes event (mission) to the users through pop-up or banner in the app and provides rewards when the user has joined events.

In-house campaign by the Toast Analytics automatically provides the indices including the surge of user volume due to the campaign as well as the performance analysis from the sales increase. You can also easily target the object meeting the purpose of desired campaign in order to maximize the campaign effect.

You need to go through below processes additionally in order to use the campaign feature. This document includes detailed explanation on how to perform each of the processes.

1.You need to apply Toast Analytics SDK to the app client in order to expose campaign and handle rewards. 
2.You also need a communication between game server (or application server) and campaign server in order to notify the user in case the user had accomplished mission or for checking the rewards.

##Terms

##Description on Key Synchronizations 

###1. Applying TOAST Analytics SDK 
In order to use Analytics Campaign feature, you first need to apply Toast Analytics SDK to your application. 
Please refer to the end part of this document for more information on application and you can also refer to the “Toast Analytics API Reference” provided additionally. 

###2. Setting a Campaign
Although you can directly create a new campaign, using the template, you can create your desired campaign in an easier and quicker manner. 
You can register a new campaign through the [Run Campaign] in Toast Analytics website. Please refer to the [Page Guide] located on right top of the relevant page for more information.

###3. Registering Test Device 
Before exposing the campaign to the general users, you need to test first to check whether the campaign is normally shown or operating. Before registering the testing device, acquire the Device ID and Device Token first through Toast Analytics SDK.
You may register the testing device by going to Analytics website and clicking [App Setting Button] > [Set Campaign] > [Set Testing Device].

###4. Proceed with the Campaign Test 
Once the testing device is successfully registered, go to [Campaign Operation Menu] > [Campaign List] > [Test Button]in the Toast Analytics website and start testing.

###5. Check Campaign Operation 
And then, you will need to check whether the campaign is operating normally using the testing device. Please check the operation in below 4 stages. Go to the [Page Guide] in the right top of the Toast Analytics website for more information on each stage. 

However, checking mission accomplishment & reward status is available only within the campaigns set with the mission and reward feature.
- Expose: This stage refers to a status when the campaign information has normally been delivered to the testing device, thus being ready to be exposed.
- Implement: It refers to a stage where you had successfully joined the campaign through banner or pop-up exposed in testing device.
- Mission: It refers to a stage where the mission data has been normally delivered from the game server to the campaign server.
- Reward: It refers to a case when the information had been successfully delivered from campaign server to the game server. 

###6. Expose Campaign
Once you had completed the test for campaign, you may open the campaign for external users to access. If the app has reached the campaign exposure location (Refer to ‘Set Campaign > Set Exposure Location’ section) upon campaign launch, the campaign will be revealed to the general users. 

###7. Mission Completion and Rewards 
If a user had conducted a certain action (for instance, a change in level or ranking) to achieve the campaign’s mission, the game server will call campaign server API (check mission) to verify whether the mission had been accomplished or not. 
If the mission is successfully accomplished, the reward information will be sent from the campaign server to the game server and the game server has to send the reward to client based on such information.

#Apply Game Client

[Image 2 System Flow]

##Game Client 

The explanation will be based on Java Code for better understanding of the concept. Please refer to the ‘Programing Guide’ provided respectively for more information on each platform.

###1. Initialize

You must call initialization function in order to start using the campaign feature.

```java
GameAnalytics.initializeSdk(getActivity(), appId, entId, appVer,  useLoggingUserId);
```


Before requesting for the campaign information, register Campaign Listener first.  
```java
GameAnalytics.setCampaignListener(campaignListener); 
```

Below Callback is provided in the Listener.
- onCampaignVisibilityChanged : It is called when the campaign/ reward related pop-up/banner appears or disappears from the screen.
- onCampaignLoadSuccess, onCampaignLoadFail : It notifies the campaign information parsing result retrieved from the campaign serer. There is no need to process this Callback in game since it is only for checking the log. 

```java
private CampaignListener campaignListener = new CampaignListener() {
@Override
public void onCampaignVisibilityChanged(String adSpaceName, boolean show) { ... }
@Override
public void onCampaignLoadSuccess(String adSpaceName) { ... }
@Override
public void onCampaignLoadFail(String adSpaceName, CampaignException exception) { ... }
}; </string>
```

###2. Registering User ID
Identifying the user is a must for executing a campaign or handling rewards. In such process, the campaign uses ‘user ID’ as the identifier. Therefore, a function for setting the user ID must be called for using the campaign feature.
Please note that the user ID in this case, must be identical to the user ID sent when calling the API in the game server if the mission is accomplished. 
User ID must be a value unique enough to discern the user and it must be a string of characters below 50Byte. 
```java
GameAnalytics.setUserId(userId,true); 
```
###3. Expose Campaign
You may call the campaign exposure functions at a location where you wish to display the campaign after executing onCampaignLoadSuccess, and remove the campaign pop-up/banner by calling the function for removing the campaign from the screen once it is revealed to the users for a certain time being. 
Below APIs are provided. 
```
showCampaign(String adspaceName, Activity parent);
showCampaign(String adspaceName, Activity parent, int animation, int lifeTime);
hideCampaign(String adspaceName);
hideCampaign(String adspaceName, int animation);
```

###4. Processing Reward Information 
If a campaign includes mission/reward information, the game server will check the mission accomplishment status with the campaign server every time the user conducts an action correlating to the mission. If the mission is found to be successfully achieved, it will also send the reward information to game client. Since it is a protocol between the game server and game client, we ask you to handle this on your own in the game. 
###5. Synchronizing Push
Analytics SDK uses GCM for the campaign. To use GCM, project number as well as API key must be registered to the Analytics admin page. Sender ID also needs to be registered in SDK.
Please refer to [Google Cloud Message](http://developer.android.com/google/gcm/gs.html) document offered by Google for general information regarding GCM.
You can find out more details on how to register information to Analytics admin page in “Set Push” section in “Getting Started” document.
SenderID can be registered through “setGcmSenderId” API for SDK. 
```java
import com.toast.analytics.GameAnalytics;
public class TestActivty extends Activity {
@Override
protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState)
{
super.onCreate();
……
int result = GameAnalytics.initializeSdk(getApplicationContext(), “AppID”, “CompanyID”, “AppVersion”, false);
if(result != GameAnalytics.S_SUCCESS)
	Log.d(TAG, "initialize error " + GameAnalytics.getResultMessage(result));
}
GameAnalytics.setGcmSenderId(“123456789012”);
……
} 
```

In order to use GCM, you must register permission and receiver additionally to the ‘AndroidManifest.xml’ file.
Permissions required additionally are as below. (Please note that “APP.PACKAGE.NAME” must be changed to the package name of the user.)
```xml
<!--  Setting GCM Push Authority -->
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.GET_ACCOUNTS"></uses-permission>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WAKE_LOCK"></uses-permission>
<uses-permission android:name="com.google.android.c2dm.permission.RECEIVE"></uses-permission>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.VIBRATE"></uses-permission>
<permission android:name="APP.PACKAGE.NAME.permission.C2D_MESSAGE" android:protectionLevel="signature"></permission>
<uses-permission android:name="APP.PACKAGE.NAME.permission.C2D_MESSAGE"></uses-permission>
```

Receiver which needs to be registered additionally is as below. (Likewise, “APP.PACKAGE.NAME” must be replaced with the user’s package name.)
```xml
<manifest>
……
<application>
……
<!—Setting GCM Receiver --> 
<receiver android:name="com.toast.android.analytics.gcm.GcmBroadcastReceiver" android:permission="com.google.android.c2dm.permission.SEND">
	<intent-filter android:priority="”1”">
	  <action android:name="com.google.android.c2dm.intent.RECEIVE"></action>
	  <category android:name="APP.PACKAGE.NAME"></category>
	</intent-filter>
</receiver>
<service android:name="com.toast.android.analytics.gcm.GcmIntentService"></service>
……        
</application>
</manifest>
```

Upon receiving the push (GCM) message from the server, Analytics SDK displays notification to the Notification Bar. Touching this notification will run the app. 
If you don’t set anything in this stage, the main activity of the app will be executed. In order to execute an activity other than the main activity, you need to explicitly designate such activity additionally using “setPushIntent” function.
```java
import com.toast.analytics.GameAnalytics;
public class TestActivty extends Activity {
@Override
protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState)
{
    super.onCreate();
    ……
    int result = GameAnalytics.initializeSdk(getApplicationContext(), “AppID”, “CompanyID”, “AppVersion”, false);
    if(result != GameAnalytics.S_SUCCESS)
        Log.d(TAG, "initialize error " + GameAnalytics.getResultMessage(result));
}
GameAnalytics.setGcmSenderId(“123456789012”);
……
Intent intent = new Intent(getApplicationContext(), GCMActivity.class);
GameAnalytics.setPushIntent(intent);
……
}
```

Also, when setting Activity android:launchMode in AndroidManifest.xml as singeTop, singleTask or singleInstance, you must reuse existing activity without creating a new one.
In this case, to receive the ‘intent’ info which includes the Push information, you must explicitly override “onNewIntent” in the concerned activity. 
```java
public class NEAFlatSampleActivity extends Activity {
	@Override
	protected void onNewIntent(Intent intent)
	{
		super.onNewIntent(intent);
		setIntent(intent);
	}
} 
```

If you are not using the GCM push receiver provided by SDK as default, but directly implementing by yourself, the setting for ‘manifest’ must be changed as below.
Also, don’t forget to directly implement the logics (receiver, service and notification) which receive GCM push and handle as well.
```xml
<manifest>
……
<application>
……
<!—Setting GCM Receiver --> 
<receiver android:name="com.toast.android.analytics.gcm.GcmBroadcastReceiver" android:permission="com.google.android.c2dm.permission.SEND">
<intent-filter android:priority="”1”">
  <action android:name="com.google.android.c2dm.intent.RECEIVE"></action>
  <category android:name="APP.PACKAGE.NAME"></category>
</intent-filter>
</receiver>
<service android:name="com.toast.android.analytics.gcm.GcmIntentService"></service>
……
<!--  Setting GCM Push Related User Definition -->
<receiver android:name=".GcmBroadcastReceiver" android:permission="com.google.android.c2dm.permission.SEND">
<intent-filter>
<action android:name="com.google.android.c2dm.intent.RECEIVE"></action>
<category android:name="com.example.aflatgametest"></category>
</intent-filter>
<receiver>
<service android:name=".GcmIntentService"></service>
……
</application>
</manifest>
```

As shown above, you need to newly add user-defined settings under the receiver and service setting defined for SDK.
When composing the push payload section, “cid” field shall not be used in user defined push. “cid” field, as a tag used internally within the default push provided by SDK, is for delivering the campaign information. 

###6. Checking Device ID and Push Token 
In order to proceed with [Following Application (Game Admin)] > [Configuration] > [Set Campaign] > [Set Testing Device] section of this manual, Device ID and Push Token of your testing device are required. 
Toast Analytics SDK offers API for each platform to support you when checking the Device ID and Push Token. This API must be called after initializeSDK.
```
Android
public static String DEVICE_INFO_DEVICEID = "deviceId";
public static String DEVICE_INFO_TOKEN = "token";         
public static String DEVICE_INFO_CAMPAIGN_USERID = "campaignUserId";
public static String getDeviceInfo(String key)
iOS
#define DEVICE_INFO_DEVICEID (@"deviceId")
#define DEVICE_INFO_TOKEN (@"token")
#define DEVICE_INFO_CAMPAIGN_USERID (@"campaignUserId")
+(NSString*)deviceInfoWithKey:(NSString*)key
Unity
public const string DEVICE_INFO_DEVICEID = "deviceId";
public const string DEVICE_INFO_TOKEN = "token";         
public const string DEVICE_INFO_CAMPAIGN_USERID = "campaignUserId";
public static string getDeviceInfo(string key)
Cocos2d-x
#define DEVICE_INFO_DEVICEID_STR ("deviceId")
#define DEVICE_INFO_TOKEN_STR ("token")
#define DEVICE_INFO_CAMPAIGN_USERID_STR ("campaignUserId")
std::string getDeviceInfo(std::string key) 
```

Below coding is for printing Device ID and Push Token in Android.
```java
// Retrieves Device ID.
String deviceId = GameAnalytics.getDeviceInfo(GameAnalytics.DEVICE_INFO_DEVICEID);
// Retrieves Push Token.
String pushToken = GameAnalytics.getDeviceInfo(GameAnalytics.DEVICE_INFO_TOKEN);
// Print out retrieved Device ID and Push Token to the Logcat console.
Log.d(“Sample”, “Device ID : “ + deviceId);
Log.d(“Sample”, “Push Token : “ + pushToken); 
```

To check the log, please use Logcat for Android and iPhone Configurator for iOS.
![Project Sett](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ToastAnalytics/ToastAnalytics_EN/master/docs/Developer/images/image005.png)

[Image 3 Device ID and Push Token Printed Out to Console Log]

We recommend you to use the coding for printing out Device ID and Push Token only during testing and remove them from the actual build which will be opened externally. 

##Game Sever

###1. Game Server Authentication
The policy for restricting the access to the campaign server will be changed from ACL to another method. 
The access restriction through ACL from external party is not activated.
Additional task could be required if we decide which authorization policy to adopt. 

###2. Reward
The key task that the game server fulfills regarding the campaign would be ‘handling rewards.’ 
Game must call check-mission API to campaign server in below cases to check whether a mission has been accomplished or not.
- If there is a change in factor (values designated in game such as level, ranking, number of game play, etc.) relating with the mission setting while the campaign is underway 

If a reward is found to be existent upon calling check-mission API to campaign server, you will receive a reward code. After receiving the reward code, send it to the game client. This process shall be implemented within the game. (If reward information is delivered through rewardList field in response data, the delivery will happen only once. What you need to keep in mind here is that even though reward is not present, rewardList field will still be delivered with an empty value.) 

The API format for mission accomplishment that the game server needs to call is listed below. 

###3. Request Examples 
```json
