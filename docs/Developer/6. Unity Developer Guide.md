# Overview

This document explains the method to implement Analytics SDK on Android. In order to utilize Analytics SDK, one should register for an app. To register, refer to the link (<http://cloud.toast.com/documents/2/>).
- This document was drawn up based on Unity4 standard.
- Unity plugin function is only supported in Pro version. Therefore, application should be developed through Unity Pro in order to utilize SDK Plugin.
- Android Manifest setting, iOS Build setting, etc. are explained in Programming Guide offered by each OS.
- Contents about campaign implementation are provided in a separate document. In this document, implementation of client is only explained. As for overall contents, refer to “Campaign Implementation Guide”.



# Project Setting

## SDK downloading

SDK can be downloaded at <http://cloud.toast.com/documents/6/>

## SDK composition

When it is decompressed after downloading, there are Unity Package files and README.txt files that recorded change history.

```
	Analytics-SDK-Unity /
  - GameAnalyticsUnityPlugin.unitypackage 	// Analytics SDK Unity Package
  - README.txt                     // Release History
```

## Project setting

#### 1. Creating project
Create a new project by executing Unity3D. If there is already created projects, skip this part

![Figure 1 Create Project](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ToastAnalytics/ToastAnalytics_EN/master/docs/Developer/images/pg_unity_001.png)

[Figure 1 Create Project]

#### 2. Adding library
Import downloaded unity package file at Menu of Unity3D by selecting Assets > Import Package > Custom Package

(If google-play-services.jar and AndroidManifest.xml files are included in the version used in the game or in a different library, they don’t have to be added. Contents under “res” folder can be removed along with google-play-services.jar.)

(Please use following option when you use Proguard.. "-keep public class com.toast.android.analytics.external.leaktest.MemoryInfo { public *;}")

![Figure 2 Adding library](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ToastAnalytics/ToastAnalytics_EN/master/docs/Developer/images/pg_unity_002.png)

[Figure 2 Adding library]

#### 3. Creating Game Object
Create an empty game object, and then add GameAnalyticsUnityPluginController as a component of game object.

![ Figure 3 Creating Game Object](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ToastAnalytics/ToastAnalytics_EN/master/docs/Developer/images/pg_unity_003.png)

[Figure 3 Creating Game Object]

#### 4. Utilizing SDK
Then call Action-tracking API at an appropriate point in the game.<br />
Action-tracking API is defined in GameAnalytics.cs.

#### 5. OS additional settings
There are items that should be additionally set into project setting and Manifest setting in each OS (Android, iOS).<br / >
For more details, refer to project setting provision of Programming Guide offered by each OS.



# Mandatory Implementation
It is API that should be implemented for the fundamental statistics data gathering. Most of data can be seen just by implementing mandatory implementation.

Mandatory implementation items are the following
- Initialization : initializeSDK
- Session-tracking : traceActivation, traceDeactivation
- Purchase (In App Purchase) : tracePurchase
- Money acquisition/consumption : traceMoneyAcquisition, traceMoneyConsumption
- Level-up : traceLevelUp
- Friend count : traceFriendCount


## Initialization

“App ID” and “Company ID” that are issued after registering for the app are necessarily needed to use SDK. As for the way to register for the app, refer to the link (http://cloud.toast.com/documents/2/)

![Figure 4 Authentication Key Information](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ToastAnalytics/ToastAnalytics_EN/master/docs/Developer/images/pg_unity_004.png)

[Figure 4 Authentication Key Information]

SDK initialization should be first carried out to utilize GameAnalytics SDK.<br />
The InitializeSDK function of GameAnalytics class is a function that carries out SDK initialization. This function identifies internally needed information (device information, app setting information) and configures the environment for transporting log

```cs
using UnityEngine;
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using Toast.Analytics;

public class Sample : MonoBehaviour {

    // Use this for initialization
    void Start () {

     ……

     int result = GameAnalytics.initializeSdk ("APPKEY", "COMPANYID", "VERSION", false);

     if (result != 0 ) {
        // SDK Initialization failure
     }
     ……

     // Start session-tracking after initialization.
     GameAnalytics.traceActivation()
}
```



# User identification criteria setting
** Criteria should not be changed after opening the game because data link before and after a change can be disconnected during the operation. 

Analytics is a criterion that identifies users, using Advertise ID or User ID. Both ID cannot be used at the same time, but one of them should be chosen according to game policies <br />
Generally speaking, Advertise ID is used as a criterion. But, User ID is permitted in case of special requirements in the game.<br />
For example, if a user drops out and re-registers on the same device under Advertise ID, the user is to be counted as the same previous user. On the other hand, in case of User ID, it is counted as a new user under the same condition.<br />
Or, if one user uses two devices and utilizes Advertise ID, it is counted as two different users, whereas it is counted as just one user in case of User ID.<br />
Considering features of the two different ID types, decide which criteria to use in the game.<br />
This value can be set through the last factor (use logging userid flag) of initialization function (initializeSDK). In the event that Flag is true, use User ID as a criterion. If it is set as False, use Advertise ID as a identification criterion.

The code below is a case of using User ID as the user identification criterion.
```cs
using UnityEngine;
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using Toast.Analytics;

public class Sample : MonoBehaviour {

    // Use this for initialization
    void Start () {

     ……
     // Initialization in case of using User ID as user identification criteria
     int result = GameAnalytics.initializeSdk ("APPKEY", "COMPANYID", "VERSION", true);

     if (result != 0 ) {
        // SDK initialization failure
     }
     ……
     // log-in process completed in the game
     ……
     // a function to register for User ID in case of utilizating User ID as user identification criteria
     GameAnalytics.setLoggingUserId(“user_id”);
     ……

     // start session-tracking
     GameAnalytics.traceActivation()
}
```

If the last factor of initialization function (use logging userid flag) is set as true, User ID should be registered by calling setUserId. Unless Flag is set as true by calling setLoggingUserId, all API called afterwards will return a failure (E_LOGGING_USER_ID_EMPTY).

As for the second factor of setUserId, it is true in case of Promotion or Campaign. Otherwise, it is false.
SetUserId function can be called right after obtaining userID to use in the game after completion of log-in by calling initializeSDK.. UserID can be used as a value utilized to identify game users

As for contents regarding Advertise ID, refer to the link below.

-Android : <https://developer.android.com/google/play-services/id.html>
-iOS : <https://developer.apple.com/LIBRARY/ios/documentation/AdSupport/Reference/ASIdentifierManager_Ref/>


## Session-tracking

It is an implementation to trace DAU (Daily Active User) and stay time in the game <br />
It can be measured by calling a corresponding API in case of App start/end and Background/Foreground move.<br />
When App is first executed (after intializeSDK) or a move from background to foreground is made, start session-tracking by calling traceActivation. And then stop tracking by calling traceDeactivation at the moment of app’s moving into background.<br />
By calling traceDeactivation and measuring stay time between traceActivation and traceDeactivation, total hours of use can be estimated. Also, stop activities carried out internally within SDK at traceDeactivation.<br />
In case of Background/Foreground move, unless the function above hasn’t been called, hours of use in the game cannot be accurately estimated, so this API must be called.<br />
As for DAU, measure it through numbers extracted by getting rid of repetition of the user (Advertise ID or User ID as criteria) who called traceActivation for a day.

```cs
void OnApplicationPause(bool paused) {
    
        if(paused) {
            GameAnalytics.traceDeactivation();
        } else {
            GameAnalytics.traceActivation();
        }
    
}
```

## Action-tracking

This can trace users’ Action on In-App Purchase, money acquisition/consumption, level-up, change in friend count, etc.

#### 1. In-App Purchase
This sends information about purchase by calling tracePurchase after In-App Purchase takes place.<br />
Currency is only used by code defined by ISO-4217(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217).<br />
In case of purchasing $0.99jewelry, it is used just as below.<br />
(“GEM_10” here is an item code defined in the game. Unit Cost means corresponding items’ unit price, and payment is the actual cost that users pay. Level is designated for the purchaser’s level.)
```cs
GameAnalytics.tracePurchase("GEM_10", 0.99f, 0.99f, "USD", 10);
```
	
#### 2. Acquisition/Consumption of Goods
This calls when money is either acquired or consumed and traces the amount of change in primary and secondary goods. Generally speaking, primary goods (e.g. jewelry, ruby, etc.) are those purchased through In-App Purchase, while secondary goods (e.g. cherry, heart, etc.) are those purchase by utilizing the primary goods.<br />
In the event that 10 jewels are purchased through IAP, it is used just as below.<br />
(“CODE_IAP” here is a code defined in the game. In case of primary goods, the type is designated as 0, and 1 for secondary goods.)<br />
```cs
GameAnalytics.traceMoneyAcquisition("CODE_IAP", "0", 10, 10);
```
	
In case of purchasing 100 cherries, using 10 jewels, it is used just as described below.
```cs
// consumption of primary goods
GameAnalytics.traceMoneyConsumption("CODE_USE_GEM", "0", 10, 10);

// acquisition of secondary goods
GameAnalytics.traceMoneyAcquisition("CODE_BUY_CHERRY", "1", 100, 10);
```

When secondary goods are purchased by using primary goods, actual move of ‘primary goods decrease’->’secondary goods increase’ takes place. But, if additional goods’ consumption is not necessarily required to be expressed, it is fine to send ‘secondary goods’ increase’ log.

#### 3. Level-up
It calls traceLevelUp when users’ levels are changed. For reference, most of Action-tracking API receives users’ levels in order to trace action for every level.<br />
If a user’s level changes to 10, it is called as below. A user’s level must go up. If it goes down, accurate data cannot be estimated.<br />
For instance, in a game that proceeds through stages like “Candy Crush Sage” in which stage is used as level, only when a user first proceeds into a new stage, corresponding stages should mark a log of level-up. If a user goes back and plays the previous stage, it should not mark a level-up log.<br />
Also, level values that are sent to other API should use the highest stage level value as opposed to the currently ongoing stage
```cs
GameAnalytics.traceLevelUp(10);
```
	
#### 4. Friend
Register numbers of users’ friends. Generally, it is fine to call it at the moment when friend information loading is completed after executing the app
```cs
GameAnalytics.traceFriendCount(100);
```


	
# Optional Implementation
It explains additional indicators that users would want to utilize other than basic index provided by fundamental implementation, or the way to use a Campaign function offered by Analytics.

Items that can be additionally implemented are the following.
- Campaign implementation : setCampaignListener, (show/hide)Campaign
- Custom Event collection : traceEvent
- Promotion implementation : isPromotionAvailable, getPromotionButtonImagePath, launchPromotionPage
- Duration measurement : traceStartSpeed, traceEndSpeed


## Campaign implementation

#### 1. Campaign implementation advance preparation
Separate guidelines are provided for Campaign implementation and its execution.<br />
Refer to “Page guide” under “Campaign execution” in Toast Analytics.<br />

#### 2. Push-implementation
Push-implementation should be each made out according to App Lifecycle by each OS (iOS/Android). A corresponding code should be added to projects created by each OS after building in Unity.

“setGcmSenderId” function provided in Analytics Android SDK is also offered by Unity Plugin. But, in case of calling this function, it only works in Android. It doesn’t internally operate at all but return success every time.

In addition, when push is used in Android, it should be built, including “android-support-v4.jar” files into project. Although it is included and distributed, included in Analytics Unity Plugin, remove files included in Plugin in case that a corresponding library is already included in project or a different version is desired.

Refer to ‘4.1.2 Push implementationsection’ of iOS Programming Guide and Android Programming Guide.

#### 3. Campaign Listener implementation and registration
SDK brings information of Campaign and reward by communicating with Campaign on a regular basis. If there is a campaign to be proceeded to users or reward information, it is notified through CompaignListender..

Therefore, CampaignListener should be implemented to receive Campaign information.
```cs
public interface CampaignListener {
    void OnCampaignVisibilityChanged(string adspaceName, bool show);
    void OnCampaignLoadSuccess(string adspaceName);
    void OnCampaignLoadFail(string adspaceName, int errorCode, string errorMessage);
    void OnMissionComplete(List<string> missionList);
    void OnPromotionVisibilityChanged(bool show);
}
```
Each Callback is called in the following cases.

- OnCampaignVisibilityChanged : it is called when relevant pop-ups or banners either appear or disappear by calling showCampaign and hideCampaign.
- OnMissionComplete : it is called when a user progresses Campaign/Promotion and there is  information as a user completes targeted missions. Using the provided information here, reward should be given through game server. As for process related to Campaign reward, refer to the “Campaign Application Guide” document.
- OnCampaignLoadSuccess, OnCampaignLoadFail : it instructs Campaign information passing results. No special measures are required about this callback in the game. It is just a callback provided to check log.
- OnPromotionVisibilityChanged : in case of using Promotion, it is called when Promotion View is opened and closed

Register implemented CampaignListener through setCampaignListener
```cs
function setListener() {
    ……
    GameAnalytics.setCampaignListener(new MyCampaignListener());
    ……
}

public class MyCampaignListener : CampaignListener
{
    public void OnCampaignVisibilityChanged(string adspaceName, bool show)
    {
      ……
    }

    public void OnCampaignLoadSuccess(string adspaceName)
    {
      // for Debugging
    }

    public void OnCampaignLoadFail(string adspaceName, int errorCode, string errorMessage)
    {
      // for Debugging
    }

    public void OnMissionComplete(List<string> missionList)
    {
      // key/value information is provided by separator “|” in missionList String
// with this value, reward is provided to users after verifying in the promotion server 
// through the game server
    }

    public void OnPromotionVisibilityChanged(bool show)
    {
      // When Promotion View is opened, show is passed to true.
      // When show is true, lowering game rendering performance is possible.
      // In contrast, when show is false, game rendering can be retrieved
    }

}
```

#### 4. Campaign Show/Hide

It is a method that shows pop-up/banner registered in Analytics website in case of a currently ongoing campaign to users and hides exposed pop-up/banner. For adspaceName, which is a parameter, adaspace name can be used that is defined at the time of registration of Campaign in Analytics website. Adspace means a particular location within the game where pop-up/banner is expressed
As showCampaign() method does not operate if there is not a campaign that uses corresponding adspace, if functions are called as different adspaceNames in many other places of the game that are expected to expose pop-up/banner, game system administrator can easily promote pop-up/banner just by registering campaign in Anayltics website without changing any game client.

As for the method to register for Adspace, refer to "Campaign Test Guide.
```cs
public static int showCampaign(string adspaceName)
public static int showCampaign(string adspaceName, AnimationType animation, int lifeTime) 
public static int hideCampaign(string adspaceName) 
public static int hideCampaign(string adspaceName, AnimationType animation) 
```


## Using custom event

It can be used to define particulars and analyze them in each game.

For example, in case of Fever Time Item, use it as described below. All the used codes are defined in the game and used. The example provided down below is a code defined to trace change patterns at a particular stage.
```cs
GameAnalytics.traceEvent("ITEM", "ITEM_USE", "FEVER", "STAGE_10", 1, 10);
```
	
It can used to trace Boss Battle results at a particular level.
```cs
GameAnalytics.traceEvent("STAGE", "STAGE_BOSS_VICTORY", "DRAGON_VALLEY", "BOSS_MOB", 1, 10);
```
	
In addition to this, it can be used to trace specialized events for a number of purposes.

String Type Parameter (event type, event code, param1, param2) utilized in traceEvent can be used up to 50byte each. And pram1 that can take place at a low rank of an event can be used up to 300, and param2 that can take place at a low rank of param1 can be used up to 200.

For more details, refer to Toast Analytics website. (It can be downloaded by clicking on "Page Guide" on the upper part of the right side of Custom Event Page.)


## Promotion implementation

Use it when promotion in the game is implemented with a different game (This function currently works in Android)

#### 1. Promotion implementation advance preparation
Promotion implementation and its execution are explained in a separate guide.

#### 2. Adding promotion button
When promotion information and button image is registered in Analytics setting page, download and save it into Device at the point of SDK initialization.

Using button image in the game, button should be created at an appropriate location.

Check and see if promotion can be executed before creating a button. If the system operator has made it so that promotion is not used, or button image has failed to be downloaded, or service is in maintenance or troubled for some reason, promotion cannot be proceeded, so the button should not be indicated on the screen in such cases..

Promotion availability can be figured out through “isPromotionAvailable()”. If promotion is in an available state, created a button at an appropriate location by identifying the button image route through the function of “getPromotionButtonImagePath()”. (Save the button image in PNG format.)

(It is available to create a button by utilizing images included in game-distributed package rather than using the image registered in Analytics setting. But, promotion availability must be checked through isPromotionAvailable before creating the button at this time as well.)
```cs
if (GameAnalytics.isPromotionAvailable() == true) {
    Debug.Log ("Show Toast Promotion Button");
    string buttonImagePath = GameAnalytics.getPromotionButtonImagePath();
    if (File.Exists(buttonImagePath)) {
        byte[] imageData = File.ReadAllBytes(buttonImagePath);
        ……
    }
    ……
} else {
    Debug.Log ("Hide Toast Promotion Button");
}
```

#### 3. Executing promotion
In case of touching the promotion button, execute promotion by calling “launchPromotionPage()”.

(Utilize the user ID to check promotion reward supply availability. User ID should be input by calling setUserId prior to the launchPromotionPage call. As it is situation where promotion is used, set the second factor of setUserId as "true".)
```cs
private void touchPromotionButton() {
    ……
    GameAnalytics.launchPromotionPage();
    ……
}
```
	
Promotion contents are provided through the internal use of Web view in “launchPromotionPage()”. In order to use this function, Activity that corresponds to AndroidManifet.xml setting should be added.

“OnPromotionVisibilityChanged” callback is called when Promotion View is executed and disappears. Rendering can be stopped or re-started at this callback.

Fixing the screen width/lengthwise is set through android:screenOrientation.

(http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/activity-element.html#screen)
```xml
<activity 
    android:configChanges="keyboard|keyboardHidden|orientation|
        screenLayout|uiMode|screenSize|smallestScreenSize"
    android:name="com.toast.android.analytics.PromotionActivity" />
```

Also, Install Receiver must be registered to measure effects of advertisements at the time of installation/execution of an app.

Install Receiver is needed to measure effects in case that an app is installed through promotion (only in case of Google Play). Execution Receiver is needed to measure execution effects through promotion in case that an app is installed.
```xml
<receiver android:name="com.toast.android.analytics.InstallReferrerReceiver" android:exported="true">
    <intent-filter>
        <action android:name="com.android.vending.INSTALL_REFERRER"/>
    </intent-filter>
</receiver>

<receiver android:name="com.toast.android.analytics.ExecutionReferrerReceiver" android:exported="true">
    <intent-filter>
        <action android:name="com.toast.android.analytics.toastpromotion.EXECUTION" />
    </intent-filter>
</receiver>
```

In a case of using multiple Install Receivers, refer to “2.2.2.AndroidManifes setting” of “Android Programming Guide” for the setting method.

(In Broadcast Receiver that processes the same Action, only one can be registered within an app. Be sure to refer to “Android Programming Guide” for the method to register for multiple Install Receivers in case of utilizing Install Referrer in a different SDK.)

#### 4. Reward
Reward is provided when promotion page exposed to users. Moreover, when an app is installed through promotion or targeted missions are accomplished, reward is provided as well.

Information about reward is delivered through “onMissionComplete” “CampaignListener” of 4.1.3.

Refer to "Promotion Application and Operation guide" for the process of reward.


## Measuring duration

It can measure time taken in a particular interval. For example, it can be utilized in some discretionary areas in case of measuring time taken for tutorial, Scene switching, etc

For Intro Scene loading time, it is used as below. "INTRO_LOADING” is a value defined for particular intervals in the game.
```cs
void onStart() {
    GameAnalytics.traceStartSpeed("INTRO_LOADING");
}

void onLoadCompleted() {
    GameAnalytics.traceEndSpeed("INTRO_LOADING");
}
```



## SDK Setting

### 1. Activating debug mode
It can set log output availability for SDK log verification during development.

This function is available both before/after initializeSDK. The default value is setDebugMode(false).

(Start Log tags as “Analytics:” in android. By designating log cat filter as "Analytics" in Eclipse, logs generated in SDK can be identified.)
```cs
void Start () {
     … …
     GameAnalytics.setDebugMode(true);
     … …

     int result = GameAnalytics.initializeSdk ("APPKEY", "COMPANYID", "VERSION", false);

     if (result != 0 ) {
        // SDK initialization failure
     }
     … …
}
```

In case that debug mode is activated, contents of log delivery can be identified. Whether or not logs are properly delivered can be identified by seeing logs reacted in response after sending logs. If there is log string such as described below, collected data must have been properly delivered to the server. (XXX is an altering value depending on circumstances.)

- Android : server response (XXX) : 200 OK
- iOS : RequestWorkerThread::didReceiveResponse - <NSHTTPURLResponse: XXX> { URL: XXX } { status code: 200002C


### 2. Identifying device information
It can identify Device information collected in SDK.

Currently traceable values are Device ID, Push Token, and Campaign User ID. These values are needed to test campaign implementation. For more details, refer to "Campaign implementation guide".

Key values used to identify Device information

- public static final String DEVICE_INFO_DEVICEID = “deviceId”;
- public static final String DEVICE_INFO_TOKEN = “token”;
- public static final String DEVICE_INFO_CAMPAIGN_USERID = ”campaignUserId”;

```cs
void printDeviceInfo() {
     string deviceID = GameAnalytics.getDeviceInfo(DEVICE_INFO_DEVICEID);
     string pushToken = GameAnalytics.getDeviceInfo(DEVICE_INFO_TOKEN);
     string campaignUserID = GameAnalytics.getDeviceInfo(DEVICE_INFO_CAMPAIGN_USERID);
     … …
}
```
	
### 3. SDK version identification
SDK version can be identified in “PluginVersion” class.
```cs
namespace Toast.Analytics 
{
    public class PluginVersion 
    {
        public const int VersionInt = 0x0100;
        public const string VersionString = "0.1.00";
    }
}
```
